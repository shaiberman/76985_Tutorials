These are Matlab functions and scripts that illustrate the properties of basic magnetic resonance 
and magnetic resonance imaging.  The code is used as part of Stanford Psych 204A, a course by Brian Wandell
 and Robert Dougherty, that introduces cognitive neuroscientists to MR principles.

The functions were edited by Aviv Mezer from The Hebrew University for intro class of MRI.
